        <div class="container my-5">

            <p>There is a lot to learn but there is so much time in a day. Give us an hour and you will see the difference. Smart Work Learning uses “Peer to Peer tutoring” - a unique three-pronged approach to achieve meaningful student academic success. Our mission is to revolutionize the way students learn.</p>

            <p>Tutoring will take place online, with a minimum of two sessions per week.</p>

            <p>Smart Work Learning will communicate regularly with families and teachers to track children's academic progress and net educational gains. In general, tutoring sessions will not be scheduled at times when the child would otherwise be participating in same activities in the regular classroom.</p>

            <p>Our tutors are meticulously selected to provide our clients with the personal attention students look for in their academic experience. We take great pride in our program and the various services we provide to our students to achieve their goals. We pride ourselves in delivering the best academic Peer to Peer experience by meeting 
                <span class="h5 font-weight-bold">YOU</span> where you are in your studies. Our program is designed with <span class="h5 font-weight-bold">YOU</span> in mind. We also educate parents by giving positive and negative feedback during the tutoring process.

                    <h3>What sets us apart?</h3>

                    <p>Because we research what works and what doesn't work with today's students, we are better able to hone in on what matters most. Students are not able to get the full benefit of the traditional teaching session because they are:</p>

                        <li class="pt-2">Afraid to ask questions because they are afraid of being labeled</li>

                    </ol>
