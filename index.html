            <h4>Our Mission</h4>

            <h3>To Revolutionize the Way Students Learn by Filling the Missing Gap</h3>

            <p>There is very little time in a day, yet you have so much to learn. Give us an hour, and you will see the difference. Smart Work Learning (SWL) uses a Peer-to-Peer tutoring method. Our unique three-pronged approach is used to achieve meaningful student academic success.</p>

            <p>Tutoring will take place online, with a minimum of two sessions per week.</p>

            <p>Smart Work Learning (SWL) will communicate regularly with families and tutors to track student's academic progress and net educational gains. In general, tutoring sessions will not be scheduled at times when the student would otherwise be participating in same activities in the regular classroom.</p>

            <p>Our tutors are meticulously selected. SWL provides all students with the personal attention they look for in their academic experience. Smart Work Learning takes great pride in the various services and programs it provides to all students. They will achieve their academic goals.</p>
            
            <p>Our program is designed with <span class="h5 font-weight-bold">YOU</span> in mind. Smart Work Learning (SWL) prides itself in delivering the best academic Peer-to-Peer experience by meeting 
                <span class="h5 font-weight-bold">YOU</span> where you are in your studies. SWL also educate parents by giving positive and negative feedback during the tutoring process.

                    <h3>Peer-to-Peer Learning</h3>
                    <p>Because we research what works and what doesn't work with today's students, we are better able to hone in on what matters most. Students are not able to get the full benefit of the traditional teaching session because they are:</p>

                        <li class="pt-2">Afraid to ask questions because they are afraid of being labeled</li>

                    </ol>
